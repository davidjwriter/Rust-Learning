Oh the life of a gnome
At last, out of the garden
They finally found a home

Reminiscent of Santa Clause
But not quite as creepy
Their popularity deserves applause

Once knew nothing but dirt and grass
Now sitting in thousands of mantles
Living life in high class

Once worthless, dirty, and old
All of a sudden without any effort
They sit as we behold

Let them give you hope
For we were once seen as sinners
Made righteous by truth and hope

For us, Christ was born
That’s why we’re here today
Through Christ, we are adorned
